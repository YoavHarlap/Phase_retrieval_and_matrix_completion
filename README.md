# Phase Retrieval and Matrix Completion through projection-based algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains the code and numerical experiments from the thesis "Phase Retrieval and Matrix Completion through projection-based algorithms". The project investigates two fundamental problems in signal processing:

1. **Phase Retrieval**: Recovering the global phase vector from Fourier magnitude data.
2. **Matrix Completion**: Reconstructing low-rank matrices from partial data.

The research systematically compares the performance of projection-based algorithms under varying conditions, highlighting trade-offs in reliability, computational efficiency, and scalability.

## Features
- Implementation of projection-based algorithms for phase retrieval and matrix completion.
- Evaluation of algorithmic performance under various scenarios:
  - **Random Phase Retrieval**
  - **Crystallographic Phase Retrieval**
  - **Matrix Completion with Low-Rank Constraints**
- Analysis of robustness to noise and effects of missing data.
- Visualization of convergence behavior and performance metrics.
